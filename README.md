### Cryptocurrency Price Tracker with Notifications

This Python program simulates the prices of the top 10 cryptocurrencies, plots them on a bar chart, and sends notifications with current prices. The code is structured to refresh prices every 60 seconds, making it a useful desktop application for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

#### Key Libraries Used
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization, used here to create a bar chart of cryptocurrency prices.
- **Random**: To generate simulated cryptocurrency prices.
- **Plyer**: A cross-platform library for sending desktop notifications, providing alerts for updated cryptocurrency prices.
- **Time**: Used to control the interval for price updates.

### Code Overview and Explanation

1. **Function: `simulate_coin_prices()`**
   - **Purpose**: This function simulates the prices of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by generating random values between 100 and 50,000 USD.
   - **Details**: A list `coin_names` holds the names of the cryptocurrencies, and another list `prices` holds random values generated by `random.uniform(100, 50000)`.

2. **Function: `plot_coin_prices(coin_names, prices)`**
   - **Purpose**: Visualizes the cryptocurrency prices using a bar chart.
   - **Details**: 
     - `plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))` creates a canvas with a specified size.
     - `plt.bar()` plots the names on the x-axis and their respective prices on the y-axis.
     - `plt.show(block=True)` keeps the chart open until the user closes it manually, allowing for better visualization.

3. **Function: `send_notification(coin_name, current_price)`**
   - **Purpose**: Sends a notification with the current price of a specific cryptocurrency.
   - **Details**: Uses `plyer.notification` to send a desktop notification. The `timeout=10` option keeps the notification visible for 10 seconds.

4. **Function: `show_and_notify()`**
   - **Purpose**: The main function that repeatedly fetches prices, updates the chart, and sends notifications.
   - **Details**: 
     - `while True`: An infinite loop to continually update prices.
     - Calls `simulate_coin_prices()` to generate random prices.
     - Calls `plot_coin_prices()` to visualize the prices.
     - For each cryptocurrency, `send_notification()` is called to display the current price.
     - `time.sleep(60)` pauses the loop for 60 seconds to refresh data at regular intervals.

5. **Execution Block: `if __name__ == "__main__":`**
   - Ensures the main function only runs when the script is executed directly, making the code modular and suitable for import into other scripts.

### Usage Instructions

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib plyer
   ```
2. Run the script to start tracking:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```
3. To convert this into a standalone executable (Windows), you can use:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed your_script_name.py
   ```

### Important Note
The prices shown are randomly generated for demonstration purposes and do not represent real market data.
